## R function

Question for today:
> **Q1**. Write a function grade() to determine an overall grade from a vector of student homework assignment scores dropping the lowest single score. If a student misses a homework (i.e. has an NA value) this can be used as a score to be potentially dropped. Your final function should be adquately explained with code comments and be able to work on an example class gradebook such as this one in CSV format: “https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput” [3pts]


```{r}
# Example input vectors to start with
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
```

stundent 1 average score.
```{r}
mean(student1)
```

drop the lowest score using **min()**

```{r}
min(student1)
```

**which.min()**
```{r}
which.min(student1)
```
```{r}
student1[which.min(student1)]
```

to drop the lowest score
```{r}
student1[-which.min(student1)]
```

```{r}
mean(student1[-which.min(student1)])
```
```{r}
mean(student2[-which.min(student2)])
```
needs to remove NA
```{r}
mean(student2[-which.min(student2)], na.rm=TRUE)
```
replace NA with 0 for student2
```{r}
is.na(student2)
```

```{r}
which(is.na(student2))
```

```{r}
student.prime <- student2
student.prime[which(is.na(student.prime))]=0
student.prime
```

```{r}
mean(student.prime[-which.min(student.prime)])
```

check student3
```{r}
student.prime <- student3
student.prime[which(is.na(student.prime))]=0
mean(student.prime[-which.min(student.prime)])
```

simplify
```{r}
x <- student3
# map NA value to 0
x[which(is.na(x))]=0
# find the mean without the lowest value
mean(x[-which.min(x)])
```

```{r}
grade <- function(x){
  # map NA value to 0
  x[which(is.na(x))]=0
  # find the mean without the lowest value
  mean(x[-which.min(x)])
}
```

```{r}
grade(student2)
```

now read the full gradebook csv file
```{r}
scores <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput", row.names=1)
scores 
```
```{r}
grade <- function(x){
  x <- as.numeric(x)
  # map NA value to 0
  x[which(is.na(x))]=0
  # find the mean without the lowest value
  mean(x[-which.min(x)])
}
```

```{r}
ans=apply(scores,1,grade)

```

#Q2. Using your grade() function and the supplied gradebook, Who is the top scoring student overall in the gradebook? [3pts]

```{r}
which.max(ans)
```

#Q3. From your analysis of the gradebook, which homework was toughest on students (i.e. ob- tained the lowest scores overall? [2pts]

use apply() function over the columns by setting the margin=2 argument.
```{r}
hw=apply(scores,2,mean, na.rm=TRUE)
print(hw)
which.min(hw)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
